You’re right — **`student-db` causes a syntax error in MySQL because of the hyphen (`-`)**.
MySQL treats `-` as a minus operator unless the name is **quoted with backticks**.

Below is the **correct and safe way** to fix everything.

---

# ? OPTION 1 — Keep the name `student-db` (Recommended for you)

If you want to **keep your existing name**, you must **always use backticks** in MySQL.

Run this in **MySQL Workbench**:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `student-db`;
```

Then select it:

```sql
USE `student-db`;
```

Now create your table (run this exactly):

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `register` (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    course VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

Verify:

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

You should see:

```
student-db
```

Then:

```sql
USE `student-db`;
SHOW TABLES;
```

You should see:

```
register
```

# ? Make sure your Lambda is STILL correct

Your Lambda line is **already correct**:

```python
RDS_DB = "student-db"
```

(You do **not** use backticks in Python — only in MySQL.)

---

# ? Quick sanity test in Workbench

```sql
INSERT INTO `register` (name, email, course)
VALUES ('Test', 'test@test.com', 'AWS');
```

Then:

```sql
SELECT * FROM `register`;
```

If you see the row ? your DB is ready.

# ?? (Optional) BETTER OPTION — Avoid future problems

If you prefer, you can rename everything to avoid hyphens:

1. Create a new database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE student_db;
```

2. Then in Lambda change:

```python
RDS_DB = "student_db"
```

3. Create table in it:

```sql
USE student_db;

CREATE TABLE register (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    course VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
